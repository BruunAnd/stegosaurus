Symmetrical key
The principal behind the symmetrical key is that it is the same key that is used to encrypt and decrypt. This means that both the receiver and the sender have the same key and that both the encryption and decryption require the same key work. This method requires minimum five steps to work:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Plain text:} The plain text is the original message, that the sender wants the recipient to receive.
\item \textbf{Encryption:} The plain text gets encrypted using a encryption algorithm taking the key as input.
\item \textbf{Cipher text:} The encrypted text (cipher text), is transmitted to the recipient.
\item \textbf{Decryption:} The cipher text gets decrypted using an decryption algorithm, taking the key as input.
\item \textbf{Plain text:} The recipient has the original plain text.
\end{enumerate}
