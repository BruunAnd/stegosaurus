The Rivest Shamir Adleman encryption, hencefourth reffered to as the RSA encryption is one of the first public key cryptosystems, and is used all over the world for transmitting data in a safe and secure way.
First published by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman in 1977, the RSA encryption uses a public key system as well as prime factorization in order to encrypt data.
The data can then be decrypted by anyone who has the corresponding private key, which; if it wasn't obvious, should be kept as private as possible.

In steganography, one strives to conceal data within other data, where as the goal of cryptography is to hide data in plain sight by making it unreadable.
How ever one does not necessarily entail the exclusion of the other.

Especially when using steganography in order to transmit sensitive information the user might be interested in encrypting the data stored using steganography in the event that the data falls into the wrong hands.
This could be achieved using two different RSA encryptions with two agreed upon public encryption keys.
