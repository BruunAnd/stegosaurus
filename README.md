#What is Stegosaurus?
Stegosaurus is an advanced steganography tool, but with a primary goal of being easy to use. It uses a graph-theoretical approach with neighborhood search in order to avoid both statistical and human detection.

#About the algorithm
This algorithm handles the edge finding by using a neighborhood search, a solution that enables the program to be able to handle large messages efficiently. The algorithm is shown to be able to hide messages well, only needing to apply direct adjustment to approximately 0.1% of the vertices.
